## Commonly mistaken for

[Barbera Del Sannio](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/barbera-del-sannio) (Campania), [Barbera Sarda](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/barbera-sarda) (Sardegna), Barberùn (Piemonte), [Mammolo](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/mammolo) (Sotto Il Nome Sciaccarello In Corsica), [Neretto Duro](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/neretto-duro) (Sotto Il Nome Barbera Rotonda In Piemonte), [Perricone](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/perricone) (Sicilia)

## Origins
Some authors have suggested that the name Barbera derives from Vinum Berberis, a medieval fermented drink made from barberry with an intense red colour and an acidic and astringent taste, a bit like Barbera wines.

Barbera is usually believed to have originated in the hills of Monferrato in central Piemonte (see below). However, to the best of our knowledge, the first reliable reference to the name Barbera came at the end of the eighteenth century, when Conte Nuvolone Pergamo (1787–98) mentioned a variety known as Barbera near Asti in north-west Italy, as Ughetta near Vercelli and in the Canavese, and as VESPOLINA near Novara. (Ughetta is used as a synonym for both Barbera and Vespolina, which are completely distinct varieties.) The Count also mentioned a Vitis vinifera Montisferratensis that was often identified with Barbera, which is doubtful because this geographical name could be applied to any other historical grape from the same region (eg [Freisa](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/freisa)).

Since the nineteenth century, Barbera has often been described as typical of the Asti region. However, it didn’t become important in Piemonte as a whole until after phylloxera. The lack of trustworthy records for Barbera in Piemonte before 1798 and its relatively recent expansion suggest that its origin might be elsewhere. Indeed, a recent DNA study unexpectedly showed that Barbera bears little relation to the other grapes of Piemonte, which suggests that Barbera was probably introduced to the region relatively recently (Schneider et al. 2003). In addition, the lack of any other record of Barbera in the rest of Italy before the eighteenth century suggests that it began life relatively recently through a natural cross in a vineyard somewhere, though probably not in Piemonte, for the reasons given above. Additional genetic research is needed to uncover Barbera’s birthplace.

DNA profiling has also shown that [Barbera Bianca](/grape-varieties/Italy/white-berry/barbera-bianca) and [Barbera Del Sannio](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/barbera-del-sannio) are not related to Barbera (Sefc et al. 2000; Costantini et al. 2005). In Piemonte, Barbera is also distinct from the Barberùn scattered in old vineyards (Schneider and Mannini 2006).

Barbera was used to breed [Albarossa](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/albarossa), [Cornarea](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/cornarea), [Ervi](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/ervil), [Incrocio Terzi 1](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/incrocio-terzi-1), [Nebbiera](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/nebbiera), [Nigra](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/nigra), [Prodest](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/prodest), [San Michele](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/san-michele) and [Soperga](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/soperga)
### Alternative hypoteses

Legend has it that Barbera was introduced to Piemonte by the Lombardians in the seventh century AD. Later, a document found in the capitular archives of Casale Monferrato dated 7 November 1249 reports the church of Sant’Evasio lending to a local farmer a parcel to be planted ‘bonis vitibus berbexinis’. Several historians and wine writers erroneously transcribed berbexinis as barbexinis and hypothesized that this grapevine was Barbera. Yet it is much more likely that berbexinis refers to Berbesino, mentioned by several ampelographers as a synonym for [Grignolino](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/grignolino), [Ortrugo](/vitigni/white-berry/ortrugo) or [Nebbiolo](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/nebbiolo)], but never for Barbera.

Others have speculated that the Grisa mentioned by Pietro de Crescenzi in his Trattato dell’agricoltura (1304), the Grissa found in 1514 in the archives of Chieri in Piemonte and the Grisa Maggiore mentioned by Croce (1606) were all Barbera. However, since these names refer to the grey colour of the berries, it is doubtful that they would correspond to Barbera, and those names could have been given to several other grapes.

One recent source suggested that Barbera may be related to MONASTRELL (Mourvèdre) but DNA data strongly disprove this hypothesis (Vouillamoz).

Other hypotheses suggested that Barbera was identical to Sicilia’s PERRICONE or to Corse’s Sciaccarello – both disproved by DNA profiling, Sciaccarello being identical to MAMMOLO (Vouillamoz).

La leggenda vuole che la Barbera sia stata introdotta in Piemonte dai Lombardi nel settimo secolo d.C. Più tardi, un documento trovato negli archivi capitolari di Casale Monferrato datato 7 novembre 1249 riporta che la chiesa di Sant'Evasio prestò ad un contadino locale un appezzamento da piantare 'bonis vitibus berbexinis'. Diversi storici e scrittori di vino hanno trascritto erroneamente berbexinis come barbexinis e hanno ipotizzato che questa vite fosse Barbera. Tuttavia è molto più probabile che berbexinis si riferisca a Berbesino, menzionato da diversi ampelografi come sinonimo di [, ma mai di Barbera.

Altri hanno ipotizzato che la Grisa menzionata da Pietro de Crescenzi nel suo Trattato dell'agricoltura (1304), la Grissa trovata nel 1514 negli archivi di Chieri in Piemonte e la Grisa Maggiore menzionata da Croce (1606) fossero tutte Barbera. Tuttavia, poiché questi nomi si riferiscono al colore grigio degli acini, è dubbio che corrispondano alla Barbera, e quei nomi potrebbero essere stati dati a diverse altre uve.

Una fonte recente ha suggerito che la Barbera potrebbe essere imparentata con [Monastrell](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/monastrell) (Mourvèdre) ma i dati del DNA smentiscono fortemente questa ipotesi (Vouillamoz).

Altre ipotesi suggerivano che la Barbera fosse identica al [Perricone](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/perricone) della Sicilia o allo Sciaccarello della Corsica - entrambe smentite dal profilo del DNA, essendo lo Sciaccarello identico al [Mammolo](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/mammolo) (Vouillamoz).

## Viticultural Characteristics
Productive, ripens relatively late (after [Dolcetto](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/dolcetto) but before [Nebbiolo](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/nebbiolo)) but retains a high level of acidity even when fully ripe and a deep ruby color.

## Where it's grown

### In Italy (Piedmont)
Barbera is the most typical and widespread variety in Piemonte. It is also cultivated in Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna as well as in some spots in southern Italy. The Italian census of 2000 shows total plantings of 28,365 ha (70,090 acres), a dramatic decrease since the mid-1980s when more than thirty people died after drinking methanol-enhanced Barbera, but it is still Italy’s third most planted black variety after [Sangiovese](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/sangiovese) and [Montepulciano](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/montepulciano). More than 60% of the total is in Piemonte.

In its Piemonte heartland, Barbera gives its name to Barbera d’Asti DOCG (elevated from the 2008 vintage and allowing up to 15% [Freisa](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/freisa), [Grignolino](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/grignolino) and/or [Dolcetto](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/dolcetto))), Barbera d’Alba DOC and Barbera di Monferrato DOC (which also allows up to 15% Freisa, Grignolino and/or Dolcetto). The best areas are thought to be the hills immediately to the north and south of Alba and Monforte d’Alba in the Alba DOC and, in the province of Asti, the area from Nizza Monferrato north west towards Vinchio, Castelnuovo Calcea, Agliano, Belveglio and Rocchetta Tanaro. In recognition of this, Nizza, Tinella and Colli Astiano (or simply Astiano) have been recognized as specific subzones of Barbera d’Alba, and Barbera Monferrato Superiore had been granted DOCG status from the 2008 vintage. Growers in Asti argue that Barbera d’Asti can be superior to the generally higher-priced Barbera d’Alba because the best vineyards around the town of Alba are given over to [Nebbiolo](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/nebbiolo) (for the likes of Barolo and Barbaresco), whereas those around Asti are more likely to be planted with the local speciality Barbera.

In Lombardia, and more specifically in Oltrepò Pavese, Barbera is widely planted and produces easy varietal wines, some of them fizzy, or is often blended with [Croatina](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/croatina) or [Bonarda Piemontese](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/bonarda-piemontese). It is also permitted though used less and less in the Terre di Franciacorta DOC and appears in many a vino da tavola. In Emilia-Romagna, it constitutes 55–70% of the Guttornio version of Colli Piacentini, the hills above Piacenza, up to 60% in the Novello version and 85–100% in the varietal wines. Lighter versions, frequently fizzy, are produced in the Colli Bolognesi and Colli di Parma. In central and southern Italy its role is generally to add acidity to blends.

### Rest of the world
Further from home, Italian immigrants made sure Barbera had a home in California (more than 17,300 acres/7,000 ha in 2008). It has proved more popular than the noble [Nebbiolo](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/nebbiolo) in California with older vines in the Sierra Foothills proving particularly successful, as witness the wines of Yorba and Jeff Rundquist. The variety benefited from the Cal-Ital vogue.

Argentina had nearly 800 ha (1,977 acres) in 2007, with Norton making one of the better versions.

Along with several other Italian varieties, Barbera’s reputation has recently begun to climb in Australia, despite slow progress since it was introduced in the 1960s. Recommended producers include Brown Bros, Gary Crittenden, Dal Zotto, Gapsted, Mount Langi Ghiran and Michelini. Centennial Vineyards in New South Wales make an Amarone-style wine.

Limited plantings are also found in South Africa (50 ha/124 acres in 2008), Slovenia (139 ha/343 acres), Greece (0.5 ha/1.24 acres on Alpha Estate in Makedonía) and Israel.

## Wines profile
At their best, Barbera wines are deeply coloured, fresh and relatively soft wines with bright cherry fruit flavours.

Where the vine is overcropped (the yield allowances are generous – up to 70 hl/ha in Alba), the wines can be thin and mean. However, Barbera has been taken more seriously in the last twenty or so years and is now made in a wide range of styles, from cheap, young, simple, tart and fruity to far more expensive, dense oaked versions that benefit from ageing. This is partly due to the size and heterogeneity of the area but also to the divergent ambitions of the producers. The French wine consultant Émile Peynaud had suggested the use of oak in the 1970s but the first to experiment with this style was Giacomo Bologna with his pioneering Bricco dell’Uccellone. The use of new barriques – not to mention the more concentrated wines that tend to accompany this approach – certainly firms up the structure of such wines and adds extra body and spicy flavours but it is not universally admired and tends to significantly change the more traditional bright cherry flavours of the variety. The pure sweet fruit of the Barbera grape is arguably more apparent in less heavily oaked examples.

Most producers of great Barolo and Barbaresco in Piemonte are also able to produce fine Barbera so there is a host of possibilities (veda [Nebbiolo](/grape-varieties/Italy/black-berry/nebbiolo)), but some of those whose Barberas are obviously superior are Elio Altare, Domenico Clerico, Conterno-Fantino, Corregia and Scavino.
